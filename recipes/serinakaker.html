        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Revered by many, serinakaker are one of the traditional Norwegian cookies served during jul (Christmas).
            These buttery cookies are like a cross between shortbread and sugar cookies – rich and delicate. Their
            simple nature disguising their incredible flavor. Each small cookie is topped with a sprinkling of sugar and
            almonds that roast so slightly as they bake in the oven.
        </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <p>For about 30 cookies</p>
        <p>Cookies:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>250 g all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>100 g granulated sugar</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons vanilla sugar or vanilla essence/extract</li>
            <li>150 g butter, room temperature</li>
            <li>1 large egg, beaten</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Topping:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>1 egg white, beaten</li>
            <li>Pearl sugar (or sparkling sugar)</li>
            <li>Sliced or chopped almonds</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Pre-heat the oven to 375 °F / 190 °C. Have two baking sheets with parchment paper ready.</li>
            <li>In a large bowl or mixer, combine the flour, baking powder, and vanilla sugar. Add the butter and cream
                everything together. Add in the sugar and beaten egg (and vanilla essence, if using instead of vanilla
                sugar) and combine to form a good dough.</li>
            <li>Roll out the dough into a long sausage and divide into approximately 30 equal pieces. Roll each piece
                into a smooth ball and gently press down on the top of each with the back of a fork, creating a pattern.
            </li>
            <li>Brush each cookie with the beaten egg white and sprinkle with pearl sugar and almonds, using as much or
                as little as desired.</li>
            <li>Divide the cookies among the baking sheets and bake one sheet at a time in the middle of the oven for
                10-12 minutes, until golden.</li>
            <li>Store in a cookie tin for a couple of weeks and enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
